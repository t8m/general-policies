# Contractor Expectations and Limitations

## Contractors working hours

Contractors bill for hours worked each month and, unless agreed otherwise,
are expected to work full time hours when available.

In order to enforce a work / life balance:
- Contractors can only bill for a maximum of 190 hours in any calendar
month.  Hours in excess of this are unpaid.
- Contractors can only bill for a maximum of 1800 hours in any calendar year.
Hours in excess of this are unpaid.

## Prenotification of unavailability

Excepting illness and emergencies, unavailability of five (5) or more
consecutive days requires two (2) weeks notice in advance.
